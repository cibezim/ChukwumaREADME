## About Me
Hello there! I'm Chukwuma Ibezim, hailing from the vibrant city of Brooklyn. With a background in financial services, particularly at Capital One, I've always been fascinated by the intricacies of the financial world. My roots trace back to Nigeria, blending seamlessly with my African American identity, shaping a unique cultural perspective.

## Interests
When I'm not crunching numbers or diving into financial analyses, you'll often find me indulging in my favorite TV shows. I'm a big fan of gripping dramas like *Power*, *Snowfall*, and *Game of Thrones*, as well as legal dramas like *Suits*, *Chicago PD*, and *Law and Order: SVU*. These shows not only entertain but also offer intriguing insights into human behavior and societal dynamics.

Traveling is another passion of mine. Exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, and savoring diverse cuisines is truly enriching.
